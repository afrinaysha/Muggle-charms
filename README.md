### Project Description
The main page aims to be resources for CAT aspirants.But each links opens to some funny kids videos which we means to be useless.But still it tends to be entretaining for users.We added funny quizes and answers.Also tried to add some funny elements to make everything much exciting.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[We are pretending to provide guide for CAT aspirants.But we felt they deserve more entretainment more than getting confined to their studies.Because as a human being they deserve happiness during stress hours of studies.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[As a solution we decided to provide funny videos and elements to make them more engaging and relaxing.We tricked them to believe like all the links inside are study resources, but actually they are links to kids videos , we are ofcourse making it nostalgic and funny and entretain users]
